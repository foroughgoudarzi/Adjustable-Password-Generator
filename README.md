# Adjustable-Password-Generator

## Description

In this project, we've developed an [Adjustable Password Generator](https://foroughgoudarzi.github.io/Adjustable-Password-Generator/) application, enabling users to generate a customized, random password based on their specified criteria. This browser-based app functions by allowing users to select the desired password length and the specific character types they want to include. Upon clicking the "Generate Password" button, the application generates a password, displaying it on the screen.

Below, you'll find screenshots depicting the application in action.
